            <p>I am an army brat that was born in Athens, Greece and raised in Riverdale, Ga. I attended Lehigh University, where I majored in product design. While attending Lehigh University I became an All-American football player and was drafted in the third round of the 2011 NFL Draft.
            <br><br>
            After spending four years in the NFL, I continued my love for the arts by doing freelance design work and portrait painting. Over the past 4 years I have been able to complete projects for people all over the United States and Canada.</p>
